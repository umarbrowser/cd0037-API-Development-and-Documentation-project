# API Development and Documentation Final Project

## Project Description

## Trivia App

Trivia app is a web platform that allow people for seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application can:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

```bash
source venv/Script/Activate
```

Install frontend and backend dependencies

cd /backend && pip3 install -r requirements.txt && cd .. && cd frontend && npm install
```

## Setup the Database

With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

flask run
```

## Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use `npm start`. You can change the script in the `package.json` file.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
